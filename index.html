                <h2>What is the Grace Hopper Celebration?</h2>

                <p>The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing (GHC) is a series of conferences designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. It is the world's largest gathering of women in computing. The Grace Hopper Celebration is presented by the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology and the Association for Computing Machinery. The 2012 conference was held in Baltimore, Maryland. The 2013 conference will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>

                <h2>What is Open Source Day?</h2>

                <p>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) adoption and usage is becoming widespread and many employment opportunities require experience on FOSS projects. It can be daunting to know how to contribute to an existing FOSS project or release your individual software tool or application under an open source license.</p>

                <h2>What is OpenHatch?</h2>

                <p>OpenHatch runs education events and maintains free, web-based learning tools, to help people get involved in collaborative software development; and we work with computer programming meetup groups to help them run more newcomer-friendly and gender-diverse events. These meetup groups are educational groups that meet free of cost to educate the public on computer software programming topics.</p>

				<blockquote><i>"I've met several amazing men and women at GHC this year. 
				The most memorable that I would like to share with you is 
				when I met Sri Raga. She works for Google and does things that 
				I have only dreamed about doing one day. She is very encouraging 
				and promises to keep in touch, to hopefully give me future 
				help, encouragement, and opportunities. I am honored and grateful for the 
				opportunity to be helped by such an amazing woman."</i> - Amy Higgins, future Software 
				Engineer</blockquote>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                adjective way to apply your skills to adjective projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another noun, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of nouns collaborating across noun and noun, and
                this event specially welcomes nouns to that style
                of noun.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                noun skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
